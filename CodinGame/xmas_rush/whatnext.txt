1. If blocked with opponent - change strategy if losing/draw.
2. Extend docking points. Perhaps look simultaneously from player and item?
3. Maybe move player's tile instead of item tile when optimal.
4. Move not only when item reachable - try to evalueate all reachable tiles by distance to closest active items/count of docks.
5. At this point there is no evaluation of item tiles we would like to move towards dock! We choose whatever! Not even the closest tile!
6. Implemented evaluation based on taxi distance, but sometimes the elf tends to do stupid stuff preventing it from getting to the item - 
	it goes to the position where it forces item to change dimension in order to be able to move to the dock.
