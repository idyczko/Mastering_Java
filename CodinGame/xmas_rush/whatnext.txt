1. If blocked with opponent - change strategy if losing/draw.
2. Extend docking points. Perhaps look simultaneously from player and item?
3. Maybe move player's tile instead of item tile when optimal.
4. Move not only when item reachable - try to evalueate all reachable tiles by distance to closest active items/count of docks.
5. At this point there is no evaluation of item tiles we would like to move towards dock! We choose whatever! Not even the closest tile!
